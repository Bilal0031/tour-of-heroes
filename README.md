### Standalone vs NgModule pattern

[Standalone vs NgModule pattern](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular#organization)  
[Standalone components](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components)

Angular apps are composed of components. Until now, devs have had to create or update an existing ngmodule in order to use a freshly created component.

Ng modules (feature modules) have been used to specify which components, directives, and pipes are available to use in templates.
```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'name-card',
  template: `
    <mat-card *ngIf="name">
      <h2>Hello, {{ name | titlecase }}!</h2>
    </mat-card>
  `
})
export class NameCardComponent {
  @Input() name = 'non standalone angular'
}

@NgModule({
  declarations: [NameCardComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule, MatCardModule],
  exports: [NameCardComponent]
})
class NameCardModule {}
```

The new standalone API makes it possible to write angular components, directives, and pipes without creating an associated ng module.
Standalone components are self contained and directly manage their template dependencies.

The focus shifts from ng modules to components.

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'name-card',
  template: `
    <mat-card *ngIf="name">
      <h2>Hello, {{ name | titlecase }}!</h2>
    </mat-card>
  `
  imports: [CommonModule, MatCardModule],
  standalone: true
})
export class NameCardComponent {
  @Input() name = 'standalone angular'
}
```

## Local setup
Go through the notes [here](docs/local-setup.md).

## Create a new app and run it
[Reference](https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes/toh-pt0#create-a-new-workspace-and-an-initial-application)

### Create the app
- Create a new GitHub repo (i'm using this current one)
- Clone it down to your local and open it in your IDE   
  <img width="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/tour-of-heroes/assets/30603497/0c544d9c-2292-4c76-8af5-9bee53fe2c09">
- Open terminal
- Run the below command
  ```bash
  Ashishs-MacBook-Pro:tour-of-heroes ashishkhanal$ ng new tour-of-heroes --skip-git
  ? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? CSS
  ? Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)? No
  ```

  `ng new`
  - installs the necessary npm packages and other dependencies that Angular requires.
  - creates a new workspace, with a root directory named `tour-of-heroes`.
  - creates an initial skeleton application project in the `src/app` subdirectory.
  - creates related configuration files.

### Run the app
Go to the workspace directory and launch the app
```bash
cd tour-of-heroes
ng serve --open
```

The `--open` flag opens a browser to `http://localhost:4200`.

### Push it to Git
- Go into `/Users/coolguy/RiderProjects/tour-of-heroes/tour-of-heroes`
    - Rename the `README.md` generated by angular CLI to be different from whatever is already created by your GitHub repo. For eg: I named it `NgCLI-README.md`.
    - Hit `Command + Shift + .` to view hidden files, copy all files.
- Move all the files you copied from previous step into `/Users/coolguy/RiderProjects/tour-of-heroes`.
- Delete `/Users/coolguy/RiderProjects/tour-of-heroes/tour-of-heroes` folder.
- Add the files to source control

- Push it to Github with "Commit and Push".

## Looking at the generated files
Reference: https://angular.io/guide/file-structure

### main.ts
The `main.ts` file is the [entry point into our app](https://youtu.be/zTLDv5YIpqc?si=VrhjVmK8ItwAb7ai&t=40), where we simply bootstrap the Angular application and mount the `AppComponent` to the [DOM](https://youtu.be/NO5kUNxGIu0?si=ESJxUXRzhbhDNd0D).

### tsconfig.json
More info [here](https://youtu.be/ahCwqrYpIuM?si=w_RZN7F2rsnA-ULk) and [here](https://angular.io/config/tsconfig).

The best one is at Typescript's [official web site](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig).

### tsconfig.spec.json
https://github.com/akhanalcs/tour-of-heroes/blob/e2baa5549986680fee6664c8921ee90b3356324c/tsconfig.spec.json#L2-L14

- The `extends` statement means that `tsconfig.spec.json` will inherit settings from the base `tsconfig.json` file.
- `outDir` tells TS where to emit the compiled JS files. The files in this directory will be used by test runners or development servers to execute your tests.
- `"types": ["jasmine"]` instructs the TS compiler to include Jasmine's type definitions in the **compilation**. They are in "node_modules/@types/**jasmine**/index.d.ts" file.  
  This makes the Jasmine's types globally available in your tests files (.spec.ts). It offers advantages like auto-completion, type checking and so on, when you are writing your tests.
- `include` property tells the compiler which files should be included in the compilation. `"src/**/*.spec.ts"` means include all the `.spec.ts` (your test files) in your src folder and its subfolders. `"src/**/*.d.ts"` does the same for TypeScript declaration files.  
  The type information from `.d.ts` files will be available when writing code in any TypeScript files "included" in your compiler configuration.

### tsconfig.app.json
https://github.com/akhanalcs/tour-of-heroes/blob/e2baa5549986680fee6664c8921ee90b3356324c/tsconfig.app.json#L2-L14

- `outDir` tells TS compiler where to output JS files transpiled from your TS source. The primary consumer of the outDir files is the Angular CLI when you run commands like `ng build`.
  
  It doesn't need to be checked in, so it's in `.gitignore`
  
  <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/tour-of-heroes/assets/30603497/2cb7dd83-c207-4b4b-9cbb-6e60740fb105">

- `"types": []` is telling TypeScript to include no **global** type declarations from the "node_modules/@types" directory, which is where third-party library type definitions are typically located. By making this an empty array, it's excluding all global types from "node_modules/@types".
- `"include": ["src/**/*.d.ts"]` is specifying that TypeScript should include the type declaration files (.d.ts files) that exist within your src directory.
- `"files": [ "src/main.ts" ]` denotes that `main.ts` is the entry point of your Angular application. TypeScript compiles this file and any files it references directly or indirectly.

Note that it's more common to use "files" for entry points to your application like `src/main.ts` and "include" for additional files or glob patterns.

### angular.json (sounds somewhat like .csproj files in .NET world)
- This is a configuration file for all angular projects in the workspace. This file is used by the Angular CLI. 

  For eg: I have 1 project now

  <img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/akhanalcs/tour-of-heroes/assets/30603497/14ace215-e6bb-41ba-88d7-67dde57af9d0">

- It includes information about project-wide configuration defaults for Angular build and test tools.
- Defines how different targets are processed. Targets are predefined tasks like build, test, and lint that are executed by the Angular CLI.
- Outlines project-specific configurations such as source code locations and file name conventions.
- Handles the configuration for different environments (dev, prod, etc.).

### package.json
- Includes some metadata about the application like name, version, and description at the workspace level and not at the project level (the project level config information would be specified within angular.json).
- The version field in package.json reflects the version of your entire workspace, which can include multiple projects.
- It specifies the npm packages being used by the application. There are two types of packages listed: dependencies (necessary for the app to run) and devDependencies (necessary for development).
- The scripts here can be executed with `npm run <script-name`. For eg: `npm run build`. The aforementioned command executes `ng build` which calls the Angular CLI's build command. The Angular CLI then reads the angular.json file to get build target configuration settings for the project.
